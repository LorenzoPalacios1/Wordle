# Wordle

### Wordle is the primary driver for the game.
### WordCheck is a service that checks strings and returns a boolean value depending on whether the passed strings are valid English words or not. Can also check files (per line) and arrays.
### RandomWord is a service that returns a random word or series of random words.

All of the above files are necessary to play the game as of now.
Usually, you will only need to run Wordle if you're only looking to play the game.
However, WordCheck and RandomWord have test cases built into their main() function, so if there are any issues coming up, you can always try running them.

This project was made using JDK 20.

The amount of times I managed to win without debugging (it's not cheating) could be counted on one hand, so all I'll say is... good luck.
