# Wordle

## Wordle.java is the primary driver for the game.
## WordCheck.java is a service that checks a string and returns a boolean if the string is a proper English word.
## RandomWord.java is a service that returns a random word with a length of five(5).

### Usually, you will only need to run 'Wordle' if you're only looking to play the game.
### However, 'WordCheck' or 'RandomWord' have test cases built into their main() function, so if there's any issues coming up, you can always try running them.

### These files were compiled on Java 20, so feel free to recompile them to suit an older version (do note that 'RandomWord' is not compatible with Java versions before 11):
### Powershell: javac RandomWord.java WordCheck.java Wordle.java ; java Wordle
### Bash/CMD: javac RandomWord.java WordCheck.java Wordle.java && java Wordle

The amount of times I managed to win could be counted on one hand, so all I'll say is... good luck.
